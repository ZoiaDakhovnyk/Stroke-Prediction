Stroke Prediction RESTful API with Random Forest Model
This project implements a Dockerized RESTful API for predicting stroke occurrence based on a machine learning model trained on a stroke prediction dataset. The API utilizes Flask in Python to provide standardized endpoints for interacting with the model.
